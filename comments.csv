As a North Indian i must say that the people of South India is much responsible and United

"As a Bengalurian, i feel BJP lost because, we dint need our politicians to teach us our own religion and how to follow it. Karnataka Government, is not a platform to preach about religion. We appreciate Modiji and his efforts and hardwork at the centre. But at Karnataka, or atleast at Bengaluru, i have not seen major development, rather the roads have become life threatening. Congresa was no better in the past. Congrees has won, becsuse BJP dint deliver overall development to Karnataka. "
There is no place of hate in our beloved BHARAT üáÆüá≥Ô∏è..Jai hind üáÆüá≥Ô∏è
I'm am a Pakistani and seeing the power of democracy in India in awe. My salute to the democratic system of India. We Pakistanis should learn from India.
Karnataka is IT Hub of India. Don't disturb our cultural harmony by bringing relegious issue. We r proud kannadiga proud Indians.
We choose government not to teach us religion. We choose them for development of the nation. BJP failed to provide democratic governance. Karnataka has set the trend. I love my India and it‚Äôs unity in diversity 
This is power of educated people Ô∏è proud of you Karnataka 
"State gov should always publish a list of achievement after a year. How many road, school, hospitals are build, how poverty and inequality is handled etc. 
This should be publicly available and be compared in media with the last years and last gov. Then people can decide which party does the best job."
South Indian people showed us why they are most educated. Every other Indian needs to learn the lesson from them. Proud of you all 
In south some people are talking about religion only because of north people influence but now they are also understanding the agenda behind religion.
"THIS WAS NOT ONLY NECESSARY FOR CONGRESS
BUT IT WAS ALSO REALLY IMPORTANT FOR DEMOCRACY"
"I always kept telling this, how much powerful a party can be 
. 
PEOPLE ARE THE ULTIMATE DECIDER."
Congrats Karnataka people for voting against hate politics
"Rather than giving such small amounts of money to people, they could have laid out a plan for the total infrastructure development in Karnataka, including better waste management and recycling capabilities and trying to increase more usage of renewable sources by implementing more innovation to already created mechanisms, creating state government. Departments for that thus increasing job opportunities for people of the state ... thode thode paise de do.. ye kaisa solution hai?"
"Even after the influence of 'The Kerala Story' BJP lose the election in karnataka. 
This shows the awareness of South people towards true indian development and not religion base stupid topics "
Even as a hindutvavaadi peraon I support you guys ... Every narrative needs it's counter so it can reevaluate itself and evolve
"As a Tamilan I am very proud of my Kannada Brothers and Sisters

They outdone themselves closing the votebank of hate"
As a Tamilian.. I'm very proud of our kannadika relatives... I'm celebrating this moment Ô∏è
I'm really happy that my fellow kannadiga friends of every religion chose progress and democracy over religion and brainwashing. Thank You so much .
"That's why South Indian are more educated than every other states love from Northeast, Assam "
"Proud of the entire South India to demonstrate that India is a secular country where we can live in peace and harmony inspite of differences. So the government need not really work on creating and resolving issues which do not bother people in the first place. Rather they should be talking and working on other major issues that are actually impacting the common citizens and are the real road blocks for our economy, GDP and development at a national as well as international level. Also hoping that the opposition parties have also learnt their lesson and will actually do something for the betterment of the people and the country as a whole. üáÆüá≥"
I started my YouTube channel watching your videos sir and other creators. Your doing great job. Your not only a content creator but a great entrepreneur. Really got inspiration from u . I never miss your any videos. Thank you the deshbhakt.
This is not Congress win this is the win of democracy 
Being a kannadiga  proud of what we did  
"Apj Abdul kalam sir said 
For ""Great people religion is a way of making friends but small people make religion a fighting tool""
Our karnataka people united and took very good decision 
 "
"Proud to be a south indian (tamilnadu) 
Proud of our neighbour ( karnataka)
education is the key/"
"As a Tamilian, im so proud of our kannadiga people. "
"I work in Bangalore. I came back after my vacation on theprevious day of results. I talked to two people and they agreed that they received money to vote from both BJP and Congress

One person said that their family received money from all the three main parties, so his family of 6 divided their vote 2 for each party."
We want an India where common people can live peacefully... educated people of Karnataka choose devlopment oriented party and rejected communal party
"We kannadigas , dont want to listen to any kerala story nor to any religious drama.. We r self sufficient and we will grow. We vote for growth not hatred, we vote for our day to day lives.we vote for equality not for suppression of any upper or lower caste in the name of religion or reservation. We are one of the most friendliest in the country with much needed diversity. And if congresa turns out to be corrupt,we will get them down to ashes without a seconds thought..jai kannadambe."
"This is what i need from Indians by not supporting Hate Speech Party.
This doesn't mean i like Congress.
I like the politician who is honest.(Hard to Find )
Jai Hind"
Dhruv rather and u never fails to disappoint us
"I'm just glad that people started looking at solving local issues rather than talking only about arbitrary ideas put forward by the central BJP. 

I'm proud to be an Indian but I also believe that solving local problems is more important than worrying about something that doesn't affect us directly. Once we are sorted then we worry about the rest of the country, then the rest of the world."
This is called the wisdom of South India.
Wow. Karnataka people really showed the mirror to the hatemonger party. They have the guts.
"I think opposition parties need to watch ""The deshbhakt"" videos to know their weaknesses and formulate their strategies for elections"
"If you want to see the REAL Kerala story, watch 2018. It became the fastest movie to cross 100 cr in Malayalam. No propaganda no divisiveness. Just passion and brotherhood. Loved each second of the movie."
THE POWER OF EDUCATED PEOPLE
"well explained sir, Proud to be a Kannadiga, Hope the new government will work to fulfill their promises and development of our beloved Karnataka State"
"That's why KARNATAKA is IT hub of IndiaüáÆüá≥ and UTTAR PRADESH+BIHAR still hang in casteism, religious issues...... ."
"Unlike people of most states , Karnataka people are truly EDUCATED"
"As a Bangalorean, I am sorry to say this but I personally believe that the influx of North Indians  into Bangalore has led to increased vote share for BJP here. It would like to see some data on this though.
Also, Religious divide should never be a reason for any party to win an Election"
"This country of ours‚Ä¶ must avoid becoming a community of dreadful fear and hate, and be, instead, a proud confederation of mutual trust and respect! Love from Kashmir for bhai Akash and to you all"
Outstanding analysis! Thanks Akash ji for the nice presentation with sub titles in English by which I could understand the presentation in full! 
I think education is a lot important role playing here. When i say education its bot degrees but the thought process the way we treat each other is a lot good in Karnataka. Congratulations to Congress and lets hope they aline with all other opposition and conquer what they aim for.
"Same thing was seen in Delhi in 2020 elections, hate campaign vs campaign on local issues"
"South India has a higher literacy rate than the north. na kerala story kaam aai, na magarmach ke aansu
Hats off to the people of Karnatka for rejecting the policy of hatred,communalism and dictatorship."
Very proud on people of Karnataka 
Always happy to see the honest and balanced news coverage of your channel. Respect and love to Banarjee and team
"I am from Karnataka, every party gave money to vote. All voters took money and voted to whom they really wanted. All are educated here, godhi media doesnt work as all use their own way of news assessing."
It's good to see that people know the truth and did the right choice.
Well done karnataka people  lots of love from Tamilnadu 
"It was a bad signal by BJP that they had to bring Bajrang bali to get votes. BJP could not show what they have done so far in any state.
Modi himself ignored wrestlers protesting, I don't think such ignorance can be allowed in any democracy "
"Positive comments  thank you my tamilian brothers for showing your support for Kannadigas and every commite.. 
Jai hind Jai Karnataka.."
As a Singaporean.  I salute the people of Karnataka. This is the way to go. Indians are so hard working and capable. Hope rest of India wakes up
"Thanks a lot for Kannadigas for getting rid off this BJP. As a tamil, I was concerned about their presence in south india. Hate polictics will bite us one day. Thanks for kannadigas to keep that far way from TN"
Nicely broken down and comprehensively explained! Keep up the good work young man! May a thousand roses like you bloom across our land!
Thats the power of our South Indian unity
"Karnataka People have shown India the true meaning of patriotism, unity and progress. Congratulations and Jai Hind!"
"You are probably the only one on social media who is talking about Karnataka results. Kudos to you for this coverage. 
It's a big success for Congress!"
As a citizen of India and Karnataka i feel shame because on this election both parties have given 500-1000rs per vote in most of regions  to people from where this huge amount of money came and when our people get aware that they also encouraging corruption 
"Proud to be a South Indian 
No BJP in South state's "
One should appreciate the wisdom of Karnataka people - hatsoff!Couldn‚Äôt believe it .
I am living in Odisha from past 5 years .. i should say BJD is too good at development.. Very good development rate...  Eventually i love BJD.. i want BJD at Bihar...
"Amitsha :look at kerala
People :looked to kerala and wiped out bjp "
Voters of karnataka are waking up. Thanks Akash for providing such a well researched video. Hindustan Zindabad !!!
"My dear Kannadiga brothers have released a new movie ‚ÄúThe Karnataka story ‚Äú, and set the narrative for local elections in my home state of Telangana, let us hope we repeat the same narrative with ‚ÄúThe Telangana story ‚Äú and consign the hate mongers into the dustbin of history. Love and respect to my fellow Kannadigas"
Jai HindüáÆüá≥üáÆüá≥üáÆüá≥üáÆüá≥ jai Karnataka.
"Well analyzed, but some points missed that D.K Shivkumar is the architect of Congress strategy, and his organizational skills ensured the 40% commission slogan reached the masses perfectly. I am proud of Kannadigas, as they rejected hatred and communal politics, and instead voted against corruption, non-development, unemployment, poverty, and real local issues. It's high time that the Hindi belt  (U.P, M.P, Bihar,) of this country learns from the south Indian states that Hatred politics will not help them to flourish, instead, it will take them to the stone age. If mass migration of laborers from UP, Bihar to Bangalore, Chennai, and Kerala is to be stopped then start voting on the basis of core important development issues, vote against mega corruptions, vote against Anarchy, and raise questions against the tyrant communal politics only then you will flourish!!! Learn from the SOUTH INDIA, WHICH IS NOW BJP MUKTH!!!!!"
Literacy rate is pretty higher in Karnataka and I really appreciate their decision
"As a Tamilian living abroad, I can‚Äôt believe sometimes how much we find in common with North Indians outside India, but we seem to be so different when I used to live in India.
Just goes to show how much poison and toxicity we were fed at home. Our politicians exploit our differences and never talk about what unites us."
A big thanks to my Karnataka South Indian Brother Sisters ....
Very superior election results analysis and very strong instructions and valuable advise to political parties if they accept 
We need an educated and humble Pm for our country so vote for Rahul sir to make a better india.
"As a Kannadiga, I would like to correct few things here! 

1- DK shivkumar aggressiveness is the reason behind to attract most of the voters and he worked very hard from 1 year unlike siddaramiah who was seen only during campaigning"
Hope the same will repeat in 2024 election 
"Being a indian from Goa, I look forward to see my nation free from corruption, State sponsored media, religious politics & every hate mongering groups no matter it's PFI or Bajrang Dal... And I don't think  there's a needs to justify any of the reason cuz there're absolute proofs of their catastrophic results"
Salute to voters of Karnataka..... congratulations to Rahul Gandhi....
Thank You for a very beautifully explained analysis of the situation 
Well done this proves literally proves literacy rate of south india.
Salute to The People of Karnataka 
"Nehru ,Patel and Subhash Babu smiling from Heaven ."
Hate is temporary but love is permanent. Karnataka rejected the hate politics.
This election result is a slap on the face of the face of religion politics. People voted for unity over communal politics.
Thanks to Karnataka People Everyone came in one single line..And Voted for change
Best analysis presented by Shri. Bhakt - congrats
As a Deccani  I am proud that my Hyderabadi Karnataka region did not support any 'B' team of Bjp and extended big support to only national democratic Gandhian party of India. 
It was hopeful to see the WB primary teachers matter 
The Karnataka result shows that Karnataka people are very well educated and mature enough 
"As a neutral person , I don't think Congress can do as much as this in the centre , but I'm happy to see the balance and yes there is no wrong in EVMs . States are in the hands of the opposition while the centre is in the hands of the ruling . Welp it looks completely balanced"
for the 1st time in many many years I watch a deshbhakht episods where Akash sir showes some positivity towards congress.... it's also a big achievement 
Sidramayya mass leader of Karnataka without any controversy man without sidramayya congress not there in Karnataka sidramayya next level leader  almost peoples  voted for this person only because his honest man
"Excellent comment on Indian election.

Good of Indian election is that there is no interference of dirty politics of army, judiciary and rowdyism and illegal acts of ruling party. This confirms that there is true democracy in India, which is superb."
"This topic was supposed to be the discussion by mainstream media but unfortunately the Godi we have, is still not ready to digest the defeat of its party and waiting like hyena for some bad developments inside Congress. No word can define the shamelessness of the Godi, we have. Very unfortunate times of our democracy."
"Finally Karnataka got independence from BJP. Now people can live peacefully without 24 hours Hindu Muslim issues, corruption,  hatredness. Jai Congress "
"Don't forget the contribution of former IAS officer Sasikanth Senthil as war room chairman of the Karnataka Congress, who played a key role in campaigning and countering the BJP by fact-check monitoring."
"Fabulously explained  sir being a Gulbargian specially north Gulbargian it's a proud moment for me you took the name of our MLA madam but sir it's a humble request to you to pronounce the name of my city correctly it's ""Gulbarga"" not 'Gulbarg'. By the way, I like your videos , the way you explain the political issues "
"Respect people, dont even think to hurt their emotions...Let the elected rule, please do not teach us how to pray..eat or dress..Common man is least bothered about all such matters, they know what to do..interestingly...how to cast their votes.."
"At the end,  the policies offered and provided by AAP are accepted in southern region too.  People have to accept it. The party works for people will be chosen by people."
"respect to south India's educated and responsible peoples 
and that's why education is important for our country states like Kerala TN karnatka bengal every each states which are educated peoples live there is no palce for hate"
"Now the country have to think about having educated, intelligent, hard working, sensible, sympathetic and understanding PM. Let's hope for the best."
"As a citizen, i am happy to see this result in Karnataka. This is not just a matter of bjp's loss or congress' win, but in fact, it's a win of democracy too where ppl will vote on the basis of development and country's welfare, not for any personal agenda promoted by other opposition parties. And, ppl of South have again proved that democracy is still relevant in today's polarizing culture. A true Indian at heart"
As always.. spot on dada. It is inaccurate for people to assume that Karnataka template will repeat in Loksabha till we have a single leader being promoted as Leader in waiting to be PM.
"Because South is full of Wise, Smart and  Responsible People. That's why they chose Congress this time, for a change and a change for good. I hope people from North India learn something from them and make the voting decision wisely this time at least. It's high time for a change."
"I commend Deshbhakht‚Äôs bravery to stand firm on the side of truth. 

Salute to my brothers and sisters in Karnataka ."
"Karnataka is getting the petrol @50 per liter, LPG@500 per cylinder and Electricity inclding AC bill at 200 unit per month free per household. What an amazing Govt. I am sure the govt is going to beg from Central Govt about the illusioned dues like West Bengal govt soon will be bankrupt"
As a Bangalorean I felt a breath of fresh air wen voting results came out. Kannadigas are innocent & humble ppl. But from past few yrs BJP had poisoned environment with communal hatred.
"Bjp needs to understand that unemployment, welfare and development with ground work are more important in educated states."
"Kannadigas proved again they believe in unity, togetherness,  inclusiveness. Unfortunately North India always gets carried away on religious politics. 
Lots of love to my fellow kannadigas."
"This was expected. BJP High Command went to the extent of sidelining state's BJP leaders, irrespecting them and the Delhi BJP had a notion that they are getting votes in Karnataka because of only Modi's name. They didn't even let Yeddyurappa complete his term as CM."
"Proud to be a kannadati
Our state our pride! We the proud untied people! "
Hi Sir. I respect you very much. I hope you are standing on side of truth. I am from Kerala and I wish if you can focus on Kerala which is becoming a terror and smuggling hub. Im
As a resident of andhra pradesh and basically tamilan im really appreciate our kannada brothers and sisters u have done a great job by deciding a real leader for the state 
As a Keralite I thank my Kannadiga sisters and brothers for voting out bigotryÔ∏è
"As voting of individual remains always a secret thing, tough to know the truth. I am sure, if BJP could have won, Akashji could have made a quick video of how BJP has won. After demo, BJP/Namo won UP. I believe, this result is completely unexpected for congress and BJP. Now, going forward, can congress survive here for 05 years and govern better to ensure another next 05 years as well?"
Best work done by karnataka people 
"The definite takeaway is to present an alternative, positive agenda and not just countering BJP‚Äôs agenda, thereby falling into their trap."
"Superb  review bhai 
Excellent ur presentation "
This was necessary for the democracy Ô∏è
People of Karnataka has sent an encouraging message to the whole that for a Nation to progress we need to vote for real issues and not fake propganda!
The analysis is so good that I feel my knowledge is less and I watched it again . Well done Akash.
"Thats all i was aking for
A strong opposition national party who can challenge bjp
Ultimately a healthy democracy
Its not about congress or just bjp "
Proud to be Kannadiga.. Thank you everyone who did the r8 thing..
The X-factor in these elections was Sunil Kanugolu 
Hats off to the secular and progressive minded people of Karnataka.
"You are the only one who is pronouncing KARNATAKA and KANNADA correctly..
please continue like this.. Even ravish Kumar doesn't .."
One word i.e Education 
Congress must get its act straight.. once the party comes in power they forget all their guarantees and promises.. 
Love and respect to people of Karnataka
Nice in depth analysis done by you
"It takes guts and sheer will power to ignore the star power of Modi, the money power, the rampant polarization and the entire media machinery and stay focussed on issues and vote. Hats off to people of Karnataka!!! "

The Karnataka results have reagained a hope in democracy"
"Not sure whose win it is if you see the tussle for CM seat now. It is hard to win two terms continuously in Karnataka.  It is also hard to balance the caste equations there - It does not matter which party wins - Despite full/absolute majority, it is as good as hung."

Amazing assessment of the campaign.... and great delivery as well. Keep up the good work. We always expect unbias and honest assessment of situation from you

"Very Nice Analysis, thanks to people of Karnataka for bringing back democracy in the state. It's time for BJP mukth India"
"Not listening to protesting wrestler's MANN KI BAAT also played a role. Not only in Karnataka, but people all over India are very angry for plight of national heroes, especially women wrestlers, who are on roads for weeks waiting for justice. Arrogant leaders often forget that there is some supernatural power which comes to the rescue of honest people and punishes the guilty leader."
Karnataka people's are too smart 
Hats off to people of Karnataka. 
Great Analysis. Wonderful Deshbahkt. Not a Andhbakht
"I'm from Andhra Pradesh, 
Here also politicians are not perfect...... infact they are as corrupt as North
But believe me or not people never believe in hindu muslim fights
I don't know how MANY people are graduated, but most of South Indians are educated"
Great win for the rational people of Karnataka.Ô∏èÔ∏è
This is what happens when then youth of the country focus on their future rather than focusing on the religion politics that some people are trying to make a fuss about
"Congratulations Karnataka you have chosen wisely . The latest findings showed that in 2018 total number of MLA's with Criminal cases=35 and Serious criminal cases=22.



In this election here is the tally total Criminal cases=145 and Serious criminal cases=88"
Educated and knowledgeable people born in South Indian 
I love South India especially I love karnataka

"Mein shukriya ada karti hun aap tamam youtuber ka jinhon ne ground reporting ki thi Karnataka ki jis ki waja se people of Karnataka ne apne aas pas hone wale sahi galat ko samjha aur apni bahtri ke liye vote Kiya,proud Karnataka citizen "
Well explained our Karnataka state election 2023 
South always choose democracy over religion
"Hats off Rahul Gandhi 
Kudos to democracy "
"Best line ""Shakti ne takat ko Hara Diya"" "
It also happened in jharkhand assembly elections 2019
The Karnataka result shows that Karnataka people are very well educated and mature enough.
"Two main points missing :

1. First point is Budget. Central Government employees(Apart from Railways, Navy,etc)  across nation are unhappy with the yearly budgets of BJP. "
Results apart. I like how my karnataka people voted maturely differentiating Lok sabha and Vidhan sabha
South Indians are more educated. Religious politics cards cannot be played. People need  economic development plans.
"I have been waiting for your opinion since results. Thanks for sharing the video. There is news everywhere,  so many youtubers putting up their views,  but didn't watch any of them just waited for your video."
Biggest takeaway- Isbar EVM ekdum thik se kam kar raha tha
"Few additional points
Amit Shah wanting to merge Nandini with Amul- it will affect local farmers of Karnataka.
The entire Hindi should be know we kannadigas love our language kannada."
"Sir could you explain, whenever and wherever congress wins, we see anti national slogans. Why these people don't believe that india is our country and what they want to show , if their political party come they will openly harm other religion."
"Thanks almighty and to My South Indian brothers and sisters who voted against hatred. And made BJP free South India.
I hope North Indians also realize and vote against hatred and make Trillion, Super power and actual democratic India with love between each and every indians irrespective of religion caste and language."
@14:04 Akash's analysis and humour are so on point
People of Karnataka have shown that they value progress and their state leadership
Very wise people congratulations 
Well researched analysis Akash ... keep it up..
10:12 This was the best moment of the election coverage  The news channel Lmao (Makes it clear how much media bias is going on)
A big salute to Kannadiga brothers for keeping democracy live and rejecting unwanted issues
Also there has never been a single instance when KN Junta given chance to the same government consecutively. BJP want to do what it did in GJ and UP successfully. Once in power.... it should be there for a long duration. Mohak Mangal Explained it better in his video on KN.
"H.P and karnatka state politics was treated similar to that of UP, Bihar and WB. This Chambal-Hugly belt requires encounter- type actions until basic law and order is established. But rest of the States need progressive Governance,  innovation, instead of religious tensions.
- BJP will have to come out of its ""One Nation- One narrative"" mentality."
Maza aagaya Ô∏èaapki true wali speech sunkar thank you love from Karnataka banglore...
"As a true BJP supporter, I can say that the lower level BJP politicians are corrupt and that is the main reason of defeat. But it doesn't mean that it will impact 24 elections. And it is impossible for Congress to win elections in big states like Gujarat and MP where people vote on the basis of infrastructure development and nationalism, not on the basis of language and localisation, just like in the south. 
Anyways congrats to the people, now they will the same ultra speed development which is going on in the non BJP states like WB, Delhi, Punjab etc "
Karnataka election result also explains that they rejected those leaders not  spoken in regional language
"Congratulations people of Karnataka,you save humanity and democracy"
I am happy not because Congress are winning but because of a healthy democracy always need competition
BJP tried to create Congress free India.  We made it a BJP-free South India.  Now in 2024 BJP will be Mukta Bharat.  I am proud to be a South Indian
"As kannadiga
If you ask me why Congress
won in Karnataka,
Because here most of the ppls are Christians are Buddhist"
"Congrats to people of Karnataka for the victory of Democracy which is saved now..But one thing, we should only talk about unemployment and development issue. why there is always freebies and more freebies, more chances to win also. He should expain this also in this video.Please Don't give taxpayers hard earned money in freebies for your benefits and votes whether it is BJP or congress or any other party. Thank God EVMs are not hacked this time."
Very detailed explanation superb
Thank God for this result!!! It was much needed
Difference between north and south .........  i appreciate Kannadigas mallus Tamilians telugites 
This is just an appreciation comment for Akash and the entire Deshbhakt team. You people are doing a fabulous job. Keep shining and keep growing. Best wishes to you and your team. Thanks for everything 
People's of Karnataka and Delhi really educated 
Excellent episode  
Love the way you present bro
Beautiful authentic and reliable analysis mr banerjee. Best wishes.

Karnataka public has shown that they are not at all interested in cheap politics which has become an integral and inseparable part of the BJP. Kudos to the Indian National Congress for such a big victory...
"We all Indians are one, please don't divide us."
The Karnataka results proves that there is still chance for change and democracy People are actually want development so they rejected hate and communal agenda
"Well explained sir, i am from Karnataka."
"Proud to be a kannadiga
King is back "" Siddaramayya""
This is real ""The Karnataka Story "" 
South India rejects BJP"
"U seem so happy as expected with these results ....y don't u find any flaws in the opponents that is also evident...cn u make an episode on the disappearance of Subhas ch Bose,on the suspected demise of lal bahadur shastri,homi bhabha,etc thousands of such incidents ....n yes the emergency laid down by our respected Indira gandhiji...cn u throw some light on it..."
Such crisp and comprehensive explanation! Amazing summary. Your channel might be of excellent use for UPSC aspirants. Keep it up. Kudos to your team!
People have shown BJP the mirror. It was much needed. Doesn't matter whether Congress does any better or not. But point is BJP needs a strong retrospection and shift in mindset to focus on people-centric agenda. Not zumla
Whether we like AAP party or not but as a Delhiite i can say this party always fight elections on local ground issues atleast in Delhi.They don't engage in communal issues.Always do Positive campaign.Thats why they win in Delhi
We are with education technology army power. Jai kannadiga
"Great decision by Kannada people.
It was really required for Congress."
"Congress was never a party of uniform idoelogies. It articulated various intrests of different groups and mobilised people as an umbrella party and that system was termed by experts as ""Congress system"".
Way ahead for congress is very clear. It has to reinvent itself as new umbrella.
Only diference from past will be that now different ideologies are present as different politicial parties."
"Thank you, Karnataka! Speaking from my heart: You have saved our country and its democracy. Before BJP folks troll me, I will say this: I have no problem with your ideology until you start becoming violent, abusive and openly communal. Lastly, it's so good that people don't vote on caste and religion like in North India. BJP almost always uses the divide-and-rule communal card to hide its failures and corruption. The kind of abusive language our PM uses during election rallies is astounding. Thanks, Congress for leading the way to a better future for India, not just Karnataka. Love won. Hate lost. "
Karnataka people are really educated state  congratulations for your great decision.
I would request you to create a video and case study on the Baby Ariha case in Germany showcasing the many shortcomings of the Indian MEA and External Affairs Minister.
Excellent video very informative
Excellent news analysis and good job.

South is more educated than North Ô∏èüáÆüá≥
knowing that Gujarat is going to be in bad situation in coming days..feels real sad...rip gujarat
CONGRESS SHOULD NOW BE AWARE THAT THEY SHOULD BE CAREFUL IN HANDLING THEIR MLA'S BECAUSE THERE ARE CHANCES OF POACHING FROM OPPOSITION IN KARNATAKA
"I don't have confidence in the 5 guarantees .. I don't think that much money will be provided.. instead of distributing free money, guarantee of jobs and small start up loans should be provided ... As this initiative will create and increase the money flow while distribution of free money only increases pressure on the tax payers.. also this money will get lost in corruption.."

We muslim, hindu,Christian, jain, Buddhism people live together, eat together and face problems together we all people in karnataka have equal rights.. No more hate.. We focus on development of state."
Why are we thinking so much? I spoke to people here.. only reason they say why they voted for Congress is for freebies.
"The moment mainstream media started showing JP Nadda's photo instead of Modi, I realized that they are going to lose."

"I don't know how bjp lost karnataka election, but this time operation Lotus failed.. and result show that the people of Karnataka are well educated and mature "
This victory goes to  the educated people's.
South Indians are literate and educated. Proper application of mind.
Once there lived an old man. He was very rich. His elder son pretend to love his father very much but actually this son loved his father's property. Wherever this fellow goes he announced that he love his father very much. But this prodigal son started selling of his father's property to his friends at throw away prices just to lead a luxurious life. Villagers were very much unhappy with that prodigal son. He pretended to love his father but even he himself  did not know that he loved his father's property and wealth. ......
"once again, KA just demonstrated that south is vv different compared to north india."
"Congress win was a proof to all those people who were slamming Modi/BJP that India is leading from democracy to anarchy. BJP needed a slap in their face to work more on their regional campaigning/leadership rather than just relying on Modi/Yogi faces and regional divide. If BJP can‚Äôt win states like Karnataka, then I am not sure how it‚Äôs gonna win Bihar two years later."
Finally Indian Citizens Understanding there vote value and Real issues
"Thats why education is very important  for success of the country. There is a stark literacy difference between south and north india. While south indians' focus is always on development and growth, north  indians only are blind and deaf followers of modi and godi. Thats why they never think about their own development, leave aside the contry's."

"BJP increased their vote percentage in areas of Bangalore and Congress wins in the village and central areas. People saying South Indians have a higher literacy rate and are more educated (which I agree) are actually countering their own arguments as some of the most educated people living in the Silicon Valley of the east or the IT Hub of India inclined towards BJP. Just because BJP gained the votes there, you cannot just sweep it off by saying it is due to the strong presence of RSS and Bajrang Dal."
It's an effect of ignoring State main leader yadiyurppa 
Thank God this time no one is crying on EVM and democracy is dead..
No one can capture South India with hate politics you can rule on on devlopment

People are not realising in Karnataka every alternate election govt is changing from past 40 years
It's always interesting to see the election results in South. You never know who has been fooled whether it's the political party or the people.
Hope this is a beginning of a progressive secular peaceful nation!
Can this be the revival of congress? Hopefully so. Our country needs a party that challenges the current governance.
"Talking about education and literacy rates, just go to google and compare the map of Karnataka wrt  literacy rate and that of the political party which won in this election. You will find that in majority of  places with higher literacy rates bjp has won. Other places where literacy rates are a bit low majority people elected congress just because of the FREE tag they put on everything. 
Don't be a andh bhakt and trust random youtubers,most of them are founded and have their own agenda."
Proud to be kannadiga Ô∏è
"Being a resident of Karnataka,  congress won extra seats of 30 just because of announcing freebies in manifesto. even if they hadn't announced freebies they would have easily crossed 100 seats. may it be congress or BJP its good to change the government every term. I love seeing BJP and congress ruling alternative attempts. because competition will be evenly poised.( this is where you can say Karnataka people are educated :))"
"Rahul Gandhi an educated, humble, truthful, sensible & honest leader is the voice India echoes with....He is our next PM in 2024"
Perfect Analysis..very true 
"Pro-poor tactic will work in 2024, in my opinion. There‚Äôs a huge sentiment against BJP that it‚Äôs anti-poor and pro-rich. Congress also has the historical track record for being pro-poor and Rahul Gandhi‚Äôs image of being down-to-earth and humble will also work in their favour. There‚Äôs credibility and trust. If they can convince the people, attack the price-rise issues, attack the privatisation and Adani issues effectively, they will put up a very strong fight in 2024."
Didn‚Äôt bjp do a lot of things they had mentioned in their manifesto that hot them elected in 2014 -2019. Yet somehow the only reason modi will win is because opposition is not united?
This is not Congress win this is the win of democracy  
"For a change it is okay that Congress has won but giving rice free of cost, schemes like gruha lakshmi can make people lazy and encourage them to live their life in a same manner in the long run. That would encourage unemployement or rather to say unemployable graduates. No party fights election based on employment and industrialization. We would like to see the schemes which promotes small scale businesses and business related to product developement and manfacturing which can create jobs across the earning classes."
Congratulations deshbhakt team..for ur efforts to show real face of Modi nd bjp
Main reason is Karnataka has more educated people who do not believe in religion while voting
"I'm from Mizoram, we have Mosque and Hindu Temples here pre independence era, we never experience communal violence. We have ethnic tension which is very common amongst tribal but never communal in nature. Look what happened in Manipur, it is a clear ethnic conflict but the other side is burning Churches. This is something new. Manipur is a BJP ruled state by the way. No honour, no respect"
No one will survive in south except Kerala if they do not prove the model of money / revenue generation on ground for young state people as donation model will work temporarily But actual wealth creation model last for many years

BJP seriously doesn't have anything on their plate other then creating religious disputes between states and people iam proud of karnataka for not falling for their cheap tricks as a political  leaders they should focus more on developing country and state rather then creating differences among them in the name of religion
Very Good research and narration
Karnataka people are brilliant.. not andh bhakth
"People are the Decider, this is the fact. Spreading religion and doing nothing for development, just focusing on Cities and not caring about those numerous villages. This is one of the best result in my opinion. India is a secular country every religion have the same rights. As a Hindu, I feel somewhat good bcs this is 21st century, spreading Hindhuthva won't give you food."

Congress shouldn't  just give freebies . It is straining and burdening the exchequer.
Common people want peacefully life. Auto immune disease politics never work long. Karnataka is a hub of education. They think wisely. Congrats
"I mean if the government is willing to do so much, I would be will to pay extra taxes as well. However, there needs to be accountability in place and health benefits should also be integrated somehow.

In my humble opinion, I think taxes should be first utilized to create a safety net for the citizens before splurging them on not-so-important endeavours. "

"I don't support congress but finally good to see some opposition. Its a good sign for the democracy, after all, it is designed on the basis of checks and balances which were missing from last 10 years. I know it is still impossible to defeat modi in 24 election but need a healthy opposition for the same. It doesnot take time for any individual or party to be corrupt or ""propoganda"" centric if they have limitless power. I don't say any of these parties are good but there need to be healthy competition to get best output and schemes for the people of the nation."

The election in Karnataka is like replacing one set of crooks with another set of crooks.

As a Tamilian I salute the kannadiga people. They have showed the whole country that they are not hate mongerers.

"Narendra Modi and BJP had said in Karnataka Elections, Bajrang Bali will teach a lesson to those who insulted him. They were right "
To be honest we didn't rejected MODI. We rejected corrupted Karnataka ministers. If this happens in Congress then we'll reject them too. 
Hope Congress doesn't become over confident or starts to relax after the victory thinking 2024 would be a cake walk.
As a south indian i would say that most number of people join isis from south and most dangerous religious problem is in south india and south people will realise that soon. And one thing rss is very strong in most of the south states
Karnataka election results: BJP‚Äôs vote share hasn‚Äôt decreased even by 1 per cent. Congress gains at the expense of JDS‚Äô loss
the defeat in Karnataka elections is the defeat at the battle of stalingrad.
"I am proud of my state today...!! I grew up saying hindu-muslim doesn't exist in my state and in last few years i was seeing hijab ban, halal ban, etc happening in my state. I was so baffled, what is happening to my state. But people of karnataka showed they don't buy hindu-muslim, and the state i remember is true."
Today we as people of karnataka have shown what's democracy and have rejected a hateful virus which is BJP
Chacha hope with this honesty you represent the truth in future
"We are not against Modi, we were fed-up with local leaders."
This result has given some hope in Indian democracy. It proved that Hindutva is not invincible. That evil can be erased. They did maximum damage to India and normal Hindus. Now it's a shame to say that one is Hindu. But Kannadigas showed their sense of sanity  and restored some dignity.
We need BJP government love from northeast 
"Akash, Thank you brother for upholding the Democracy 

Yes this is the people scripted real "" Karnataka story "" unlike fabricated n racist so called Kerala story "
"Gentle advise to Karnataka new govt is to build as much as new schools possible and also brighten your current education system to extreme good quality by investing more. So that BJP will never come to power again and reign dividing based on religion and cast!

Hats off from Kerala."
He neglected the alarm bell rung by the 40% dispensation.
"Rahul Gandhi just proved that votes can be won with propagating peace, a peace March, unifying people instead of dividing the country, even Kerala story did not work in karnataka."
"This episode is iceing on Congress winning the Karnataka Assembly Polls.
Nice, dil bagh bagh ho gaya....."
"The only reason I see the win is offer of free bee's. BPL card holders got carried away by this. What will be the impact of this is still not known. Congress main leaders were also seen in the streets of Karnataka through out the election campaign with all public stunts like putting Dosa,  bike ride with delivery person bus journey with ladies. "" Free bee's was the main catch""."
"As a person from Karnataka, I would like to tell other friends that this is not the most intelligent mandate from people that is possible. Party jumpers, corrupt politicians, those who have distributed money have won from many rural areas, across all parties. The urban crowd, however, has mercilessly rejected incompetent and corrupt MLAs across the parties and this has hit BJP most. This is comparatively very mature mandidate overall, but still a lot of scope for improvement exists in rural areas. Rural crowd is still innocent and easy to manipulate."
"Half of irrigation funds total funds to gujurat,,,,,people r observing everything,,,south indians well educated they understand politics and religion are 2 different aspects in hinduism, we don't mix them together,,, we have deep understanding of religion than north indians.

"Finally, the DeshBhakt emerges like a mushroom in rains, after a few years of drought. "
Bro 1 correction. BJP is 66 Congress is 135 and JDS is 19
"The main point is people in southern states (‚ÄòNOT‚Äô that ones that migrated from other states due to IT boom) are much cultured, aware, balanced and educated. Hence game changer."
This is an excellent  analysis.
the political parties really need to watch these channels for better and more correct informations 
"Well a lot of people are saying that BJP lost in Karnataka, because of the UCC and as Karnataka has high number of Muslim, Christian & ST/SC voters, they didn't like it and so voted against it (as apparently majority of South States don't have real Hindus, as most have been converted, and only using Hindu names for government benefits)."
I missed BB's reaction on this occasion. 
"no political party wins 20 seats by just 13 pc vote share, as there is no perfect distribution of vote share. How did JDS  win 20 seats with so vote share , that too by fighting all the seats. Had their support been concentrated in few areas then they would not have contested in all the seats."
"Finally, one party dominance is on the way to the end... Hope Congress keeps on fighting  for our nation. Jai Hind"
"Akash, i don't know what people in Karnataka urban areas sees in Modi? They were supposed to be educated ones  and the rarional ones, to be atleast moderate ones and even be secular. Unfortunately it was not and it shows even if u get high class education, it doesn't change pre- established mindset of certain people."
"Bangalore vote share increased as there are lot of Hindi speakers who are predominantly inclined to vote for BJP, And upper middle class, upper caste"
"Generally I am convinced that the Congress is a much more corrupt and non development oriented party compared to the BJP.  The BJP is generally far ahead in development agenda.  So, hope after the win, Congress has genuine development ideas and the intelligent people of Karnataka have not voted only for the freebies.  Lets hope the Congress can achieve what they havent acheieved anywhere...i.e development"
Despite  being a bit right winged. I feel this loss is good for Indian democracy. Far too right ideologies is not got for us. So much needed balancing.  Also this also highlights that our election procedures are really strong. Despite being a currently ruled by BJP no malpractice  which is evident by win by congress. Congrats to the winning party.
This can be a strategy to turm the EVM to their own profit in 2024

Just see the difference in voice of akash when UP results came in and when Karnataka results came in
Actually kerala story is a blockbuster in Karnataka and people are getting aware of the traps but in elections bjp state leaders made huge corruption and congress announced unimaginable freebies which made them to vote for congress. And i bet Karnataka people solidly vote for bjp in lok sabha elections mr admin save my comment or pin me. Out of 28 seats modi will win atleast 20+ seats.
I live in Karnataka ( Dakshin Kannada District). I am not from Karnataka just posted here. I saw rallies of BJP and even AAP in my village where I am posted but not Congress. This points to me that more then choosing the Congress people of Karnataka have rejected BJP.
That's why karnataka is the best state in india we all should learn from it.

This news made my day yesterday  I am so happy that hate lost
"Shah said "" look at the kerala for right decision"". That is exactly what they did"
"From West Bengal , tell us about the primary teachers matter in detail,"
"BJP claim that all the citizens against BJP are anti-nationals(sometimes claim as terrorist too). Congress has won, shown the unity, and shown BJP bhakts that only their hindutva strategy wont work among educated people."
Recently visited gangnapur to pay a visit to datta mandir near karnataka border and the amount of uncleanliness and garbage made me think of some african slums. I dont care whos government is voted in but my god they need to focus on other area in Karnataka apart from Bangalore
"I am from madhya pradesh, and in upcoming election congress is comes in power here"
Most happiest person right now is Akash Banerjee 
Well said .
Its simple bro...to prove that . If Congress comes to power what will the situation of common voter's
I was eagerly waiting for video.. Thank you akash
"We South Indians are educated and we don't believe in what's app forward,    warna whatsApp par fake videos kuch ziyada hi bardgai the"
"Superb, comprehensive analysis, Aakash and team. One point about ideology you brought in at the end needs more highlighting. Rahul is clear that frontal attack on BJP and RSS ideology is needed without any fear of being branded anti Hindu. Is the Congress ready for it?"
"The outgoing govt is largely  to be blamed,Bommai in particular.Congress like AAP promise a lot but people do not understand that they will be charged high taxes and other means to have the money."
Karnataka did not reject 'Modi'. Modi was not standing for elections from here. Karnataka rejected the BJP state candidates & unfortunately the default option was Congress.
Congress jati vaad aur free bees ke vajah se jeeti hai na ki development ke vajah se 
In rural areas congress given 1k to every family to vote for them one night before elections...
The Deshabhakta video In 2024 :- Why Maharashtra rejects Gaddar & BJP.
"I am from Karnataka, BJP were crossing their democratic limits here, they first started to target innocent Muslims and later other minorities. It felt like they were taking our freedom and rights.

I agree congress is also a corrupted party but in the end it all matters is who can provide the peace in Karnataka, No doubt congress and Aam admi are one of those who can fulfill this."
INDIA IS A SECULAR NATION. ITS A BIG WIN FOR DEMOCRACY. CONGRATULATIONS KARNATAKA 
Not being cynical but I really hope that NCP can form the next government. It‚Äôs good for democracy and people of India.
One thing i have to say is that the antinationals in south like to be a separate country and it is not possible india will stand united until RSS is n india
The only good news I‚Äôm hearing after a decade I‚Äôm so thrilled to hear about the victory.. wishing them the best and many more victory.. BJP sucks sud not win anywhere.. Modi sorkar sud lost pls peoples open your eyes don‚Äôt be or pretend to be blind we need a btr govt for that we need a btr and understanding PM. Let‚Äôs support congress 
Legends got the secret code 
"Rahul Gandhi ji is so simple gentleman, living in the heart of people of kannada through Bharat Jodo Yatra "
Really u r a great and dynamic journalist  secular and without fear  I long salute to u
Hope the elected party keeps up with the expectations of the people
One reason for congress is freebies mentioned in guarantee card! It might be dangerous to progress of nation.
I don't understand why operation Lotus has been so normalised and accepted in a democratic country. Is there no one to stand against this.
"Congress was always making headlines in the news like paycm ,40% etc"
"This should happen all over the world, not in India only. No election should have religion in main focus because religion is one's belief. No one has a right on any religion. Everywhere local issues should be in focus. No wonder why Sudhir melted tonight at 9"
Sidelining worthy leaders like Yediyurappa has cost this loss
I agree with you Akash but you know BJP never makes the same mistake twice while congress will carry forward the karnataka formula in upcoming state elections on the other hand BJP will analyse it's mistakes instantly and change its strategy & allow more local state leadership to flourish all am saying is it took 9 years for congress to understand what it's doing wrong in the elections.
united states of south india  supports democracy and work and talk logic/ policy..  ..this is the start of the end of arrogance and hate
"People didn't see strong leadership in BJP at local level and they were dependent on MODIs image. They were thinking any idiot can win using MODIs image. but that didn't work. MODI is MODI, no one can beat him. Don't know how new government funds the announced 5 guarantees. Will they able to produce so much of revenue generation? or will they increase tax on working class? or will they do Loans? or will they get any donations? don't know they have not made it clear. But for sure, if these are funded from unethical ways, people will suffer for sure. it's better not to fall prey for these guarantees."
Middle class people need to think and vote.. else we suffer ‚Ä¶ no one is caring tax payers‚Ä¶
Love your videos to the core. Keep up the good work Sir
"I feel,  UP Bihar  should also have educated people like Bangalore and South India , people in North are mostly brainwashed in the name of religion and all, hard to see it"
Hope and wish and call for congress to do a really good work in this tenure. And PLEASE STOP n DON'T DO CORRUPTION.. BE CLEAN N TRANSPARENT
Happy for karnataka
"That 40% ad and the 40% youtube short from RaGa were awesome .
That ad and its BGM is still running in my head."
"I am from Karnataka,and i feel  shame for those who voted for  Congress for 5 Facilities .And everyone  knows this will not happen "
"We r karnataka  people  , proud of our ideology  "" ‡≤∏‡≤∞‡≥ç‡≤µ ‡≤ú‡≤®‡≤æ‡≤Ç‡≤ó‡≤¶ ‡≤∂‡≤æ‡≤Ç‡≤§‡≤ø‡≤Ø ‡≤§‡≥ã‡≤ü"" Ô∏è - ‡≤®‡≤Æ‡≥ç‡≤Æ ‡≤ï‡≤∞‡≥Å‡≤®‡≤æ‡≤°‡≥Å(‡≤ï‡≤∞‡≥Å‡≤£‡≥Ü‡≤Ø‡≤æ ‡≤®‡≤æ‡≤°‡≥Å)"
"Many powerful leaders in Karnataka are Hindu but every Muslims and Hindus support them , because Karnataka=no natak"
Hats off Kannadiga from Kerala 
MODI MAGIC LIKE A BLACK MAGIC REALIZE BY KARNATAKA JANTA
As a Gujarati Muslim the hate that BJP is spreading across the nation is pure cruelty and creates divide. I am proud of people of KARNATAKA to support a party based on possibility of progress and welfare of the people. I hope this awakens the rest of the India.
"I am from Karnataka and I voted for BJP this time.Though I was not very impressed by BJP this time the BJP MLA candidate in my constituency was better than that of Congress and JDS. Its time for BJP to stop bringing up Hindutva or Religion issues. We people can take care of our religion, political parties should focus on development and progress."
"i feel one factor for BJPs unsuccess is media , coz in south no one really cares abt Godi media , and each regional party has their own media outlet , so the fight is mainly in between regional parties , BJP do got some presence in the recent years compared to previous elections"
Finally the people realised that the the Congress was the lesser evil. The BJP miles ahead by corruption in their short tenure. 5 years of BJP corruption surpassed all the years of the Congress.  The people all over India should realise this next year
"Karnataka's GDP growth  was good under bjp,high fdi under bjp but due to their local mismanagement they got this defeat which is good."
"kerala files

kashmir files

sindhi files

once again the educated people of south showed their education to BJP
All I can say is because of dethroning Yedyurappa
"If it goes this way then, today it was Karnataka, tomorrow it‚Äôll be Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Chattisgarh, Telangana and in 2024 ‚Ä¶ the whole of India for the Congress "
DK Shivkumar should be given a important place in center as Congress strategist.
was waiting for this episode ü´∞
"There is nothing like that, here people support to which ever party they trust in and sometimes congress new comers are good and bjp bad, sometimes opposite,  so it's not about modiji it's about state not national level."
City of Bangalore had more support to Bjp because of those infected religious minded people from North india. They should be aware of the results shown by the Kannadigas that there should not be any hatred of any religion/cast/creed.
Now congress can not claim that EVM is hacked. because by this EVM mechanic they won Karnataka. So they should not blamed this time.
People are fed of seeing Modi so they rejected BJP. Those days are over where people blindly vote seeing Face of Modi..This is not UP
What a silent message with ur tee shirt. Hats off Akash ji. U r the best.
The Karnataka election result is  the defeat of Basawraj government of his mistakes and corruption allegations. This is not the defeat of Modi always remember no one ever can or ever will replace 'Narendra Modi' in national level! 
If you want to manipulate normal indian just use religion but most of the people from South are highly educated and use their knowledge practically unlike rest 
The real reason is AAP didn't participate. Cong took all the strategy that AAP maintains.
"As a andhbhakt 
Ye sahi hua sirf election ke waqt hindu hindu karte hai 
Naahi 
CAA "
Well done people of Karnataka. Cheers
If there was anyone else other than Raga for PM. CONGRESS would certainly stand a chance
I hope and wish that UP also rejects this hate politics in the next elections ü´°
As a state to fulfil these 5 promises - state treasury has to release fund of 62000 crore per year for next 5 years consecutively. That is end of the day pure tax payers money. Then this will lead to 7.5 Lakh crore DEBT for the state. Thus the data is very clear as state will become more poor and cash to debt ratio will be extreme high as 20% of revenue will be spent for this. If This continues as charity then people of actual needy will never undergo the process of wealth creation to support the overall GDP
BJP's hindutva politics works best majorly in North Indian parts and that is a big problem for the country... Ô∏è

Chalo ek chiz toh pata chalti hai.  Ki literate state like southern of India main public hindu muslim nahi khrid rahi 
"Hatred thrown out. You can fool some people all time, all people sometimes, but not all people all the time.
Time to bring in our old India back where all Hindus, Muslims, Christian's, Sikhs etc lived in peace without fear."
Congress won on free free promises. Voters of Rajasthan has already understood value of promises and Karnataka will also know in due course of time.
Great decision by the people of Karnataka. Our beloved PM didn't even spared a single word for the sufferings in Manipur. Good riddance.
"I am very happy for Congress, finally we can hope from a party who can unit religion together,bye bye hindu muslim politics"
"Wonderful analysis

Chennai"
north Indian people get awareness nowadays . you Join with South Indian people to change in political field
I m surprised bcoz so many educated people were telling that they don't have any problem with BJP in interview anyway I am very happy

"I am a Bengali brother of u dear. You could make videos in Bengali too. I don't support BJP regarding any other policies but what they are doing against Muslims is good. They deserve it. Urdu speaking Muslims in India are mostly anti Hindu and terror minded.
  
But selling every public sector unit privatization of bank increase in prices are the major causes for BJP loses. Moreover BJP is making rich richer and poor poorer. Mehul Chowksi Nirav Modi looted India with Modi's help, same is being done by Adani. "
I fully agree with the negative sides of BJP cited by you as the reason for their debacle in Karnataka. But the kind of dole politics adopted by the Congress party is deplorable too. It can win elections but ruins the State in the long run. Take the example of West Bengal. The TMC have won three elections but see where did they land the State to.
I have been your follower and approver since two years
As a congress voter I am very happy that we won in ka against corrupt bjp state govt. But will vote for bjp when it comes to centre
Congratulations to Karnataka people for standing against hate politics.
BJP has to give ticket to a right candidate and well educated. And for hard working person with no commission.
"I still don't understand why freebies get so much buzz. Do people really want to leach off of political parties and governments rather than earn on their own? 

I've seen this both in North and South India and especially in states with mediocre ""education"". A systemic grassroot change is needed in society if that is the case. To date I've seen no party tey to teach a man how to fish, they just wanna give them fish everyday to get their support and keep the people poor and needy."
"The videos will find reasoning that is suitable with the result...many factors - freebies is bad when not balanced properly.....Anti-incumbency is going to be there - Polarization has been there even with the winning party.... religion and caste equations has become more important than any other factors...Is hate not being spread against so called upper castes by the seculars? whoever comes, hope good work happens.."
Ye govrment bik gai 2000 hajar me 
Hope the BJP's IT cell and their strategy makers take some points through your videos and understand that all nationals of the country are not andh-bhakt.
IT Chief of BJP Amit Malviya exhibited his arrogance nature once again while answering  Mr.Sardesai‚Äôs questions . He lost his cool as he was not able to answers questions of  Mr. Sardesai. He should be replaced or retired by BJP for their own good & keep up their image.
On an average south india has more literacy rate comparing UP etc. So what we can infer is any educated person never falls in trap of religion based politics.
"Congress's hit last ball sixer by announcing bajarangdal ban, bjp thought this is self goal by congress but realized when results came congress bagged they lost match whole karnataka crucial 25% Muslim voters who vote JDS every time they shifted congress after this announcement which includes pfi too, congress aimed at bjp post but they shot at JDS post, well done"
Modi & Shaha had thought that people have granted Jumla & forgotten the gift of Gandhi family & could see the dark inside  figure of Modi Shaha & RSS . This is the true fact. People have brought bjp respecting the decency of democracy but not forgotten that was the gift of Neheru to us which is irritating to Modi & RSS . We are not so full as Modi has thought up.
"Karnataka never voted for bjp they voted for edurappa,
It's leftists think that they voted bjp
If edurappa was in congress they would have voted congress in last term,
Balance is required or else the central government doesn't care,"
"Congress should not simply rest on leurels of the Karnataka win. It should move ahead planning positively to tackle the incoming Assembly Elections in Rajasthan,Madhya Pradesh, Chattisgarh and Telangana with a greater vigour as well as enthusiasm. For the Greater interest of the Nation, it should chalk out an alternative agenda accomodating all the Opposition within the state level as far as possible and as per the requirement of the ground realities for 2024."
"South people are ‚ÄúDravidians‚Äù fighting to earn knowledge and income, not fighting for religious things . Only one reason- no bjp and Rss  North Indian people are blindly following RSS"
"The change was necessary. 
Karnataka achieved it.
People want change ."
"I am a Muslim, my best friend's name is Ketan
my father's best friend's name is Gopal bhai

Thank God Karnataka choose development not communal violence. 
No one is taking about the fact that Congress was distributing TVs to people in exchange of vote ..........yes guys i am from Bangalore and they gave me one too
"Very good analysis of Karnataka poll result. Yes, it's a win for democracy & democrstic forces. But sad to note that you missed great public encounters of Priyanka Gandhi & Rahuk Gandhi by directly challanging Modi ji. That type of campaign also is a big reason for Congress astonishing win."
That's what Kannadiga can do....‡≤ú‡≥à ‡≤∏‡≤ø‡≤¶‡≥ç‡≤¶‡≥Å..
"Let's hope Congress doesn't throw this result away and continue this momentum till 2024 elections and win atleast 22 of 28 seats in karnataka which they ofcourse did not do in MP,Raj and Chattisgarh in 2019.
And let's hope INC wins MP and retains chattisgarh and solve rajasthan problems"
jai yedyurappa
"Apart from hate politics(which most don't like), BJP is the closest party we have in India who can do actual growth development.
Freebies culture can be a popular thing among poor... but not sustainable for future.
This Karnataka BJP govt. did much corruption which is Congress forte. And hence the result."
i like the third scheme.
Kudos to your research team and you akash each information you have given is real from coastal to Bangalore you and your team have done your detailed research 
big ups to karnataka! Ô∏è
Hate politics should be rejected everywhere . Our country is only beautiful if it not polarised. Live in harmony.
I hate bjp but I hate Congress even more after winning people of Karnataka were shouting Pakistan zindabad. Ek nayi party banani hogi. Aur agar na ho payi toh ye kisi din mere haath se bahut pitega
After these majority seats win it will leads to Rahul vs Modi in 2024 election and BJP will form again full majority government in central level due to all the other opposition in backfoot.
God is watching. 
"Superb analysis. By the way, couldn't help but notice and appreciate your tshrt and the color coded organization of your books."
"Congress in-fight for CM post is very concerning. Congress politicians are very selfish, unlike BJP politicians. Karnataka chose bad between bad and ugly."
"Congrats Congress for great work 
Modiji and shah  please stop this hate campaign , publics are awake"
"Coming up soon, North trouble too!!!!"
"As a Kannadiga who voted for BJP in the last state election, I would say they were slow to deliver on their election manifesto. 
The only memorable instances of BJP, its ministers including CM Bommaiah over the years were:
- Abolish wearing Hijab for School girls
- Pass laws against 'religious conversions' and 'Love Jihad''"
"What about 10kg rice,200 unit current free, 500 on gas, free traveling  for women in bus, 2000 for women,  3000 for degree graduate, and so on. that is why they won election. And now people are not ready to pay current bill they're saying we Will not pay current bill because congress as won the election "
"I am from kerala and i am a Hindu.. Iam happy that BJP is in kerala is big zero. Zero MLAs, Zero MPs"
"Good congress gaurantee is pure reflection of AAP's governance model..
Undoubtedly AAP has changed the Indian politics.. 
Now we need to see execution of their own guarantees.."
"Bjp is going to win on the basis of religion in states such as UP, Gujarat, Somewhat Maharashtra and lastly MP. Karnataka has proved that they will not fall for any religion stuff. Proud of Karnataka and hats off to Congress."
People of Karnataka chose Vayu(LPG)  over Vayuputra(Bajrang bali) 
"Probably the removal of monopoly of a government would be a success for the country as it likely to limit the corruption. The governments of parties AAP, BJP & Congress to be selected un different states of India. 
Civilians are doing their best look at their contributions in riots, 26-11, etc etc"
"Created cast feeling, religion  feeling, created problem to hindus to Hindu s . Only BJP leaders Hindus ? Others not Hindus ?"
"Proud to be Indian muslim
Proud to 100 perc Kannadiga. 
Jai Karnataka Meri jaan"
Now Congress should work hard for development of Karnataka
Now Nadda is held responsible for the catastrophic loss.  BJP mostly lost where Modi campaigned. People don't trust him. And Congress won 80% seats where Raga Bharat Jodo Yatra went!
Execution wise Siddaramaiah has proved in his last governance
"Too many reasons behind the failure of BJP in Karnataka are: 

1. No eminent face other than modi ji n too much dependence on him  
2. Weak state leadership; over-smart MPs , netas thinking they will sustain only due to Modi even if they they don't do anything."
"People voted against high petrol prices ,high LPG price ,unemployment and last moment bjp leaders jumping into congress.."
"It is a myth that BJP came to power in Karnataka based on Hindutva model, it was never the case. They came to power only because of politics of Yeddyurappa and people were fed up with other parties at that time. Unfortunately BJP high command themselves forgot it, sidelined local leaders and tried to create ""Gujarat"" or ""UP"" model. This utterly backfired. Conversely, local Congress kept RG's role to the minimum, worked hard and won. Bharath jodo has worked mostly as Congress jodo. RG don't has much credit to take here."
He seems so happy with Congress winning.
"Delhi then Punjab now Karnataka kicked BJPs ass like never to be voted ever again, hats off to Delhi the first and brave city kicked BJPs ass and made future bright with AAP party..only AAP party hope for indias bright future"

"Karnataka peoples are eager to look into Bengaluru story like kasmie files and Kerala story.
Karnataka people's  want to keep credibility of EVM.
Karnataka peoples want to  dissolve JDS .
And finaly they want  free livelihood."
Simple - People want FREEBIES than DEVELOPMENT!
"Love Karnataka....We have to vote to our leaders on the base of their duty,work,Service....But this leader become religious,history leader..Only preach..Or do nothing..Hats off South India..We have to rise like Singapore,Japan,China,Sweden,Norway,Finland..As GDP per capita.."
"Main reason why BJP lost was overconfidence and weak leaders.
They didn't campaign a lot.
Whereas all went crazy for the free stuff"
No hindi forcing in the south we are identified by our different languages n proud of our culture
Title should be why Karnataka rejected BJP
"PEOPLE OF KARNATAKA have clearly rejected slogans like Bajrangbali ki jai, Vande Mataram, etc. Very nice to see 

BJP OUT OF POWER FROM SOUTH INDIA. Real Issues were High Price of LPG Gas Cyl./Petrol/Diesel, BBC DOCUM

ENTARIES, Bharat Jodo Yatra, Joblessness. BJP deserves this defeat for its arrogance."
Can you please share where it was said that 15L would be given in the back account. Don‚Äôt just bluff. Talk also about how free free options is going to make people lazy and is this a good idea just to win elections
"1.Karnataka one of the big industrialised state and Bangalore had many PSUs generating plenty of employment
2.Karnataka was set to become leading educational institutions.
3.Leading scientific research institutions in Bangalore. CPRI, GTRE, Artificial intelligence, CDot, Cdac, NAL, ISRO......
4.Concept of making Silicon valley of India by visionaries and Bangalore achieved it. Rs.10,000 computers and teaching centers, foreign electronics giants made Bangalore a International IT center."
Background book arrangement is 
Rahul Gandhi said during his campaign in Karnataka ‚Äújitni aabadi utna Haq‚Äù but non of the secular media platforms conducted a debate for such slogans but if the same slogan was given by a bjp member in north India like in UP these pro left liberals/secular media platforms would have been shouting against such slogans and making the masses aware how these slogans can ruin the situation of minorities in the country but if it is said by Rahul then it‚Äôs alright and you people call yourself unbiased media
"4:01, Congress'5 guarantees is not for the development instead its selling the state, free schemes are never a option for development its like a lolipop,sweet till you have it once finished gives you diabities."
It's funny to see how people are linking this victory to literacy rate 
The Strategic Man DK Shivkumar
"As a citizen, and dravidian  i am happy to see this result in Karnataka"
"200 units free, 3000/- for unemployment, free bus travel for women, 2000/- for women head of family are the main reason for Congress win."
In bangalore there was no Modi magic. The 16 seats won by BJP are almost traditional BJP bastian. Congress won 12 seats which are also traditional Congress bastian. The only difference is that the congress lost 1seat of jayanagar constituency to BJP by just 16 votes.
Akash why don't you do a research over Manipur Crises ?
"Now CONgres need to deliver what they actually promised, hopefully Karnataka would become New york"
"Just for fun 
Bjp as  opposition party jeete gi toh dukh hota
agar opposition party jyada votes se   jeetegi toh bahot jyada dukh hota hai "
"Feeling so happy for Congress
I hope the Congress party will fulfill their promises "
Modi did lot of mistakes. And people reflected the truth of it. Well-done Congress.
Modi drove Rahul out of his house and people of Karnataka provide the state to him.  Bjp took his MP seat and the people of India will give PM post. People power
History repeats itself ‚Ä¶.. jo jo bhi deccan par rule karna chahta h uska samrajya khtm hone lgta h and this was the 1st phase for bjp next coming soon !
"As a tamilan i know karnataka congress government always against tamilnadu in kaviri issue 
But for me...anti tamil government is better than religious bjp ...love from tamilnadu"
Karnataka ke log fir se 2014 ke pehle wala hindustan chahte hai jisme apne aap ko hindu/indian bolne me inferior feel hota tha
Once BJP had only two MPs after that they started poaching on dissidents from other parties namely Congress and came to power in some states and centre but thay will face the worst dissent issues with time tasting their own medicine.
"Hope Congress now delivers to the people and doesn't repeat the mistakes of the BJP
Hopefully this is the beginning of the end of Modi and the BJP"
"Renamed :

Bombay Karnataka > Kittooru Karnataka"
"Am from karnataka, Hubli voted BJP  and we won"
Karnataka people are educated they know what development BJP has done 
Obv they are foolish people to reject Modi Ji. They will pay for their decision
"Gajab analysis, Gajab flow & speech, intonation, interpretation & the ' tongue in cheeks'. Splendid indeed"
"What a terrible choice by people of Karnataka. In spite of Congress supporting and appeasing openly only one religion, tukde tukde gang and making no progress for the country, somehow it is the choice. No wonder we were divided and ruled by Mughals and Britishers for 100s of years. We simply can't stand united for once."
"ENTIRE CONGRESS CAMPAIGN SHOULD NOW WORK VERY VERY HARD IN THE NEXT 1 YEAR TO DISLODGE BJP IN 2024 FROM POWER, BECAUSE IF BJP COMES BACK TO POWER IN 2024, NOBODY CAN DISLODGE THEM FOR NEXT 10 YEARS. PRIYANKA GANDHI SHOULD STEP UP THE CAMPAIGN AND SHE SHOULD TAKE HER POLITICS NOW VERY SERIOUSLY. POLITICS HERE AND THERE IS NOT GOING TO FETCH VOTES"
Sabhi parties ko ye free ki bheekh  band karke employment par kaam karna chahiye taaki khud kama sake log
"As far as 2024 is concerned, Karnataka will give at least 25 MPs to BJP. Other states can't say"
"One community were paid money, in broadday light...so many whats app videos, one guy went on using voting machine in the name of others...what u expect"
"Great analysis Akash. One more point helped Congress.  Clear, emphatic stand on trouble makers like Bajrang Dal, a destructive Hindutva outfit."
"Karnataka isn't rejected Modiji, it missing a local strong head and wat ever the garanties mentioned it isn't available for any one its meaningless"
"Congrates kannadigas, Enjoy free electricity, bus pass, free money every month. good job."
Its not Hyderabad Karnataka or Bombay Karnataka. Why would  you want to associate a state's region with the capital of another state. It's a no brainer to atleast respect a state's territory by addressing it properly.
"Karnataka has not rejected modi. It has rejected BJP at state level only.
Karnataka still supports modi/BJP at national level."
"I have voted Modi twice and will do again for lok sabha becauae Congress has nothing but disappointing for the last 70 years, but I voted against Modi this rajya sabha election because of their incompetency here in karnataka absolute corruption."
Was eagerly waiting for this very well explained  sir
"Karnataka did not reject modi. Karnataka rejected local BJP politicians who failed to do development.
Congress is not that great party but people needed change and some fools even voted for free things which will definitely drive us into debts"
"Karnataka people's verdict is against Price hike Petrol, LPG, electricity bill, 40% corruption, Unemployment, GST, failure of health care system, atrocities on women, fee hike, Implementation of NEP, Hindhi imposition, privitasation of Airports etc burning problems and emotional factors. Therefore in all regions BJP has lost."
Giving freebies to people is not a 'kaarnama'.
Education  is matter proud to be Kannadigas
Dude it is not Modi‚Ä¶.The locals‚Ä¶BJP could not find the better
"Kudos Akash bhaiya

Sirf ek baat ka dukh hai ki Rahul ji kuch saal pehle hi aise prayaas krte to desh ka satyanash na hota
"As far as I can remember you critisised the beneficiary luring policy of BJP and me personally too is against creating beneficiaries using hard earned money of taxpayers like me. I would like to know what's your view now as Rahul Gandhi has announced a series of beneficiary schemes as soon as Congress came to power in Karnataka. No party in India is concentrating on developing the country by working on issues like unemployment, skill development rather they are just trying to buy votes."
"I have seen many of the commenters saying that kannadigas are educated, so they chose congress over BJP . Yes you are all correct. We know what's right and what's wrong. There is no strong leader in Karnataka BJP party. There were several issues like hijab, 40% commission etc in the last few years, which made huge impact on BJP government. So kannadigas decided to send them back. And Percentage of voters of BJP is same as last election, but percentage of voters of JDS has decreased, so many votes have shifted from JDS to Congress, so Congress got more Percentage of votes compared to last election. "

South India always remain with congress. even after horrifying emergency rule.
So much analysis is not required because the history of the State shows that incumbent government is thrown out as evidenced in last 38 years. Lesson for Congress is to put up a united front else they may end up no.2 in states like Rajasthan
minorities have united to remove bjp... most of the area were covered and voters turned up... dangerous situation..
I really enjoyed  bhakt banerjee show today. That is master piece .
"BjP must come forward based on individual  development,  should not come forward by keeping religion as a agenda , BJP must come forward to enhance INDIVIDUAL PEOPLE OF INDIA ."
"If u see the stats, in Bangalore and coastal regions, which is more prosperous, educated and developed, people have voted for BJP. The whole analogy of south indian educated class rejecting BJP is myth. They were with BJP and will remain so and vote share proves it. Where as,  the regions congress won like central and north karnataka, which are comparatively  under-developed, with higher poverty,  voted for freebies promises offered."
Mr.Desh bhakt .. Is it right to win elections by giving sops rather than development in gdp.
"Lets  accept one hard truth. None of the parties fought election on development.
BJP fought elections on Hindutva
Whereas 
Congress fought elections on freebies "
"Very good analysis,but just like the title of the video and last statement in the video, subtle bias against BJP and Modi is also visible. Analysis had better be impartial."
Am belonging from North india but i love South Indian  because they people r well educated
Our karnataka people not rejected modi they welcomed government that provide everything free 
Communalism and hate speech never last and can't destroyed the unity of the Indians. A big lesson to Modi and his Big Master.

BJP BL santhosh removed Jagdhish shettar who is lingayat caste. Lingayat are majorly responsible for more than 90 seats. BL santhosh who is Brahmin wanted Joshi a Brahmin to make way for him to become CM. There is no currently senior to become   CM other than Joshi.

This is not a winning of Congress  people just choose these unqualified party because they have no choice....

I know BJP have a lot of flaws but Congress is not enough for opposition....

"Lingayat's believe they are of different religion NOT Hindu. Lingayat's religion evolved in opposition to excesses practiced by brahmin's. The BJP now became too much for Lingayat's. Loss of Lingayat's is loss permanent for BJP. Telugu's are a big minority in Karnataka. Telugu's this time didn't vote bjp, they understand very much what BJP doing in AP, Telangana. BJP should forget these states too!"

The BJP team of Karnataka ensured that they will not be voted back to power. There deeds were as such . The BJP should bring some good loyal people instead of poaching thugs from other parties.

Giving freebies. Congress wants to turn India into a completely socialist Country. If that happens we will never be able to compete with US/China or any other economically strong country. Its important we stay as capitalistic for the next decade as possible. I completely reject Congress's position on how to run the country.

All our local BJP leaders were fuddus. There are no strong and influential leaders after Yeddi. One cant win elections on the sole basis of Modi and Shah campaigns and speeches. Local leaders need accountability. Lets see how much change Congress brings.  Particularly worried about Muslim appeasement and the insane amount of freebies promised. Lets hope the state won't go bankrupt"
People of karnataka understood that Modi is not coming and ruling karnataka. Local BJP leaders only will lead stae government.  So there was no point in saying vote for Modi
Proud of my state fellow peoples 
Karnataka is not rejected  Modi but some people voted Congress using others name video is also came to light medio has no coverage to show it that is Congress means before coming to government means hiranyakasupu palane
"Bhai simple bhasha mai batau to, Kanrantak ke log hoshiyar hai unko jo chahiye,BJP ki uper se hope kam hua hai kyoki jo chahiye vo nahi mil raha milta hai jyada do, isiliye toda bjp ko side kiye hai,Parliment mai south India represent koi nahi karta our karne bhi nahi denge we are complety  neglected,
Per Capita Income is good in Karnataka but we are getting everything in high rate, current govt will increase it ife we keep govt again, and know that  by changing govt they can able to get things in managed manner, other wise current govt will apply same rule it is going  to effect some more time period  so they are changing if current govt. Kanrataka peolpe listen their heart and they are (saala) seem to be connected, politics  concentrated on basic needs of human and our Govt is not taking care then it is going to be change its several peoples choice on ground level they can obseved that all everthing is getting costlier. If BJP  Govt notices and worked on these tgey will be winner for everytime BJP not taking everyone saat they are selective now."
"Karnataka election me BJP ko ek bhi muslim votes nahi mila. Pura muslim ka vote Congress ko Gaya hai tabhi Congress jeeti hai.

Yeah thats why there were slogans of Pakistan Zindabad post elections.
The south will remain an independent kingdom
BJP are lucky that they crossed 60 plud seats. It was due to Modi and Shah they got 60 plus otherwise it would have been 20-25 seats
Because modi didnot allow to announce freebies but people wants freebies though it become diwali people don‚Äôt care future consequences

Congress gave Freebies which was First time in Karnataka, ofcourse it looked Fancy, but looking at CM's recent Reply we have come to Understand another Lal Bagh has been kept on our ears."

Karnataka neither rejected modi nor bjp we given 26 mp‚Äôs out of 28 we know the value of bjp and modi. Bjp's poor administration made them loose in Karnataka nothing else
It is not Modi s defeat because. It is related to local and hence bjp failed. Yet the percetage of voting for bjp is mot reduced but jds votes have gone to cong because it always play king maker card people have sidelined it

"After many years got this video recommended by my feed and I thought to check if this channel, atleast now tries to be balanced an neutral...to my dismay, it doesn't. After all being weighted against BJP sells and its clearly evident. Since congress has won, a crystal clear dole politics is branded as ""guarantees"", the expense for which is 62K crores per year, and which would be carved out from our pockets, but if BJP would have won, it would have immediately been branded as ""freebie politics"". Spineless ness died a thousand deaths. Sach mein ""Fake""eri hai bhai. After all some things just don't change. Ghanta agenda."

"Karnataka is contributing 2.75 lakh crores in taxes to the Central Govt but getting back only 38,000 crores as grants from the Central Govt.  The people of Karnataka perceive this as very unfair.  There are very few infrastructure projects taken up by the central govt in Karnataka compared to other states like Gujarat and UP.  Bangalore city being the dominant IT hub in the country is bringing in the majority of foreign exchange and in spite of this, the center has grossly neglected developing Bangalore into a world class city.  I hope Mr. Modi addresses these issues and builds more trust and credibility with the people of Karnataka.  Jai Hind!"

Not bad analysis.
We need congress in entire india. Congress is heartbeat of india.
Just like Delhi.. After AAP won there were communal violence.. I am expecting a similar thing which could happen in Karnataka..
"But congres is also corrupt as fck. i know agree BJP (Bommai - a communalist) in karnataka was useless, but congress is even worse bcz they never fix roads, which were in worst shape during the times of congress.

They have offered free 200 units of power, but the thing is they cut the power frequently during summers and rains. :( Not Fair."

"To all the north indians saying karnataka is next kerala, Listen I am karnataka guy but we should focus in development of the nation not religious politics, we need a responsible regime, may it be Modi's Bjp or Rahul's congress. If we hate muslims then we can just ignore them instead of harassing them lets move on. We are already called an islamophobic nation and third world country 2 big titles lol. Muslims will never be majority in india according to dew report but still some north hindus are always harassing and mob lynching muslims which brings shame to whole nation. I was islamophobic too but now i just ignore them and move on. No need of unnecessary fights. Now everyone just focus on development of the country. And Narendra Modi will win again next year and take over india but this time lets ignore religious politics and focus on development of the nation. We know to protect our dharma so dw hindus are in majority in south plus population of hindus are rising in karnataka without checking facts you north indians come and say that karnataka is under muslim which doesnt has any logic. Hindu population is more than 80% in karnataka and all political candidates are hindus so how tf are you saying that? You deserve to he called andhbakts. We know to handle muslims if they try to mess with our religion so dont worry we are descendents of cholas,cheras,kadambas, kittur chennama we have warrior blood in us. We will join north for a akhand bharath where everyone lives peacefully. But again dont teach us anything we are hindus too but with a different culture and different mindset. We want hindu rashtra too but without harming anyone of other faiths. If youre really concerned about their population growth then you can check the current stats. Dont just believe in media. I support Modi for india. But for now let us see what Congress can deliver and if Rahul gandhi and his people didnt fulfil the promises then we will overthrow the government next time so dont worry. Our south india especially karnataka is very much developed and compared to north and we need some more time to further improve it. I dont see muslims as a problem cause i barely see muslims in my city so dont worry. Hindi rashtra will form one day soon and akhand bharat too!! But following our dharma we shouldnt harass anyone. We also will bring population control bill which is very much necessary. And talking about banning hijab, then let us ban burqa(black raincoat) but not hijab, muslim girls need hijab or head scarf during their festivals thats their belief making them sad is not the way, Ban burqa but let them wear a scarf and they can remove it inside school or workplace but in public place is for safety a piece of scarf cant harm anyone and also they can remove it if they feel safe, if hindu women can wear saree in arab nations, turkic nations and even pakistan then why muslims cant wear a piece of cloth on their head? Yes burqa should be banned i agree with that. If all hold hands we can focus more on the development, which ever muslim or anyone does any crime let us give that person very serious punishment but no need to bring religious fights. Also stop comparing india with shithole pakistan or poor bangladesh, let us compare with china and grow by giving competition to it, and  Hindu rashtra will form sooner than we think but we dont need a underdeveloped nation at that time cos everyone outside the nation will make fun of us!!"

It seems they did this purposely,  so they could do vote rigging during the Lok Sabha election, and they will conveniently win, and when questioned about their win during Lok Sabha election,  they can give an example of this loss in Karnataka election. Bjp is quite smart."
"Karnataka won just because of the freebies promised by Congress nothing else. We all know the truth what Congress has done so far in the states where they are in power. None of the promise has been full-filled till now.

Mitron, I understand we have lost the battle but not the war. Ups and Downs will come but should not loose hope. Once Kannadigas will know the truth they will vote BJP back."

"Why Congress won in Karnataka. 
1) Congress has always been strong in Karnataka. 
2) BJP started dividing religions just to get votes.
3) People vote a particular member who has done good in the past in that particular area, they don't vote for a party. They vote for a person. Most of the Congress candidates are good in Karnataka."
I support Congress ..
People started thinking what's happening in this country..
Congress insults Muslims as they will not get deputy chief minister post despite helping Congress to win karnataka.. Congress puts the Muslims to its place.
Karnataka not rejected Modiji but rejected BJP because BJP not done any development in Karnataka
"Deshbhakt when I saw this news on television, your episode was the first thing that came to my mind "
"One win and all the rats come out of the holes again. Lol. Most state elections are fought on local issues. So Modi has limited say - either in wins or losses. The very same people mayvvote drastically differently in the national elections. In our state for example TRS will win by a big margin again but BJP will win 4 to 5 MP seats again. If congress wants to take on Modi again with Pappu and his Alu factory, good luck to them. This time they may end up with 20 seats.  We deserve a better opposition than these jokers."

Everyone will realise how bjp plays communal game and slowly they'll get vanished. I voted for bjp too but slowly realised they gain vote by dividing people not by working. Karnataka did the right thing and whole india will slowly come to know what game they are playing. I have hindu and muslim friends and nobody never fights but bjp created a fear and wants to seperate hindu because of majority. Nobody ever wanted a country divided but they are fighting for hindus instead of developing the country. Except hindus all the other religions are are in fear. Bjp' s policies are RSS based. As a christian i can say that india is emotional but not fool soon these culprit group will get vanished.
Or ye bolna bhul Gaya ki 1985 se har dusre election main c.m change hota h

"I was keen to vote for congress but their manifesto seemed too gimmicky and impractical. 3000 for diploma holders, FREE woman transport, 200 watt free electricity. Now say me, when is welfare not welfare. Shouldnt welfare schemes should be carefully designed keeping in mind the current state of transport and electric board financial condition? These welfare schemes dont seem to impact good in long term for beneficiaries or bring them out of poverty. And these schemes demand nearly 65000 crores of additional money for government. Just examine the worsening financial state of KSRTC and BMTC, they are already in heavy losses. And nothing is being done to help the systems caught in losses and debt. Even little improper management of money and late payment to the transport department for this free facility will create more debt for transport facility and long term loss for it. And same with electricity boards. And to remember, 65000 crores dedicated to these schemes will pool in less money for governance, maintainance,  health facility, government school facility, infrastructure. Isn't this a heavy toll? Karnataka isn't a tax surplus state to go this full on freebies for 5yrs. It's already in heavy debt. Major chunk of state's yearly budget is debt. I thought you will mention all of these. "

Congress is applying the same scheme what TMC is now doing in West Bengal. Don't you think we as Indian citizen should focus on state or country's development and should make India proud on world economic corridor?? Please stop advertising this religion biasness. We all know that religion issues are there in our country since Mughal period. You cannot avoid that fact. Somehow I feel your show is an indirect political campaign. Please try to work on Hindu Muslim issues through your show and try to reunite them as this is also important. Your show is not at all helpful"
"I watch this channel only for comedy.

The main reason BJP took such a beating in Karnataka is because of the appalling state of the infrastructure there and this was due to the unstoppable open corruption within the ranks.

"They don't rejected Modi.
Modi's test will be in 2024 you fool."
"Mr Modi president of India if you think just one can work your head and (especially not be tutu) you will understand why God they say I am higher until you can not see me you need permission  , God he says that if you say you can't just turn and live I think it's clear.  And you don't even notice, God he created the whole universe round the earth, the sky the galaxies the trees the fruits, with the finish round etc he means you turn you come back to him."

Karnataka election is proof that if you  remove rahul from campaign Congress can win.   They should repeat this in national election

"You are not completely right. To be honest you have half cooked information. 
What I feel after your review is, anyone Tom, Duck and Harry analyse the state elections result  without proper references or statistics."

People of Karnataka are trapped.. freebies fascinates them to vote for Congress this time. Thats it. Ur analysis about Karnataka is not 100% correct.
"Dont worry karnataka votes differently in both state and central. We vote based on issues related to  particular elections. Just because congress has won doesnt mean that bjp wont win central elections.
These pseudo liberals are so happy just because congress won in Karnataka but they dont discuss how will the freebies affect the states financial Conditions and hope Karnataka wont become debt ridden like Punjab. We karnataka people will see the congress govt work for 5 years and decide again next election."
"Main Karnataka ka hoon,
My dear sabh kuch free deneka baath huwa CONGRESS ke manifesto main, Aur BJP main sabh developments ka
 Isiliye jeethe nahi paye hai mere mulla bhakth..!!!"

"Your topic good but be serious, now you are a joker,"
Evey govt should be changed in every state after 5 years.Victory of congress at Karnataks state assembly is nothing special or extea ordinary.Dont try to glorify the victory of congress. You are trying to do cheap journalism.
"The moment you mentioned about 15 lakhs, you lost the respect totally. You are propagandist. Everyone including you know what was said by Modiji. But you want to make a different version of it. By the way, you did not mention ""Garibi Hatao"" of congress which was told clearly but not implemented. "

Abe andhbhakt congress win ke bad Pakistan jindabad ke nare lge Uspe nhi bologe
"ahhha people commenting karnataka people voted smart, educated, did not vote for religion .. abe gadho, musleems voted based on religious interests and supported congress. congress won majority seats in poor rural regions where education is less. bjp won majority seats from  urban bengalore region where more educated live. Lingayats switched to congress as they felt bjp let down their caste. poor people and other caste hindus voted looking at freebies. So people voted based on religon, caste, freebies in the state election. In next central election bjp is going to get majority seats because the hindus who were divided on caste and  fallen for freebies will vote based on  national interests as usual musleems will vote on religious interests and congress may get 1 or 2 extra."
Always Karnataka people rejected same Govt for second time. next time people will reject Cong
Andhbhakt modi ke godi media
"what kind of title is this ?? did Modi contested for CM post ? or he is the local MLA ? remove the title first. People has rejected the Local BJP leader not the Modi itself. they know better what is state and central govt is, they are not uneducated like you"
Please stop this ...just wait ....24  loksabha election will teach u a lesson....South never voted BJP but still BJP IS IN POWER FOR LAST 9 YEARS....FALTU BAAT BANDH KRO JI......
Han han dikh Gaya kitna developed hai tumhara Karnataka jahan pe Congress jitne ke baad log Pakistan zindabad ka naara lagate hain. Isse pata chalta hai ki kitne Anti nationalist's bhare hai tumhare state me . Aab Muslim population jyada hone se phir rote matt phirna 
Jai Rahul gandhi
"The problem is you people are so happy with the win that you forget one important thing about how Congress won the election, i.e., based on five promises which are not a good sign of governance. 
Let me explain, but first let me tell you that I don't subscribe to any party of India have no bias to left or right. 
Congress poll promises are actually bad and can even trigger domino like effect on not only Karnataka's economic health but other states too. "

Abe pagal karnataka never repeats any party after 5 years It's just an anti incumbency effect so apna gyan apne pass rakh.
"Dude don't be so happy.... Karnataka did not reject modi , we will still vote for modi next year .... We were not happy with the BJP in Karnataka not with modi ..... So relax and don't celebrate so much ....."
Yako nin akkan
Are bhai mujhe lagata ki app bjp ko support karte hoo . Apki or druv Rathee ki debate pee
Karnataka congress won by Free scheme OK..its not a win 
Congress bought votes through freebies ...i acknowledge  the fact that the BJP did not have strong local leadership and thats the main reason for their defeat...but lets not deny the fact that how karnataka evolved under the bjp goverment from 2018 to 2023 ...the data shows the picture
"One of the main reason for BJP's failure is neglecting BS yediyurappa,one of the strongest BJP leader in Karnataka...... Modi's strategies doesn't work with out BS yediyurappa....."
"Arrre.. akal ke andhey.. 
Modi ko reject nahi kiya.. Sirf local leaders ko reject kiya..  Ye sab tere  samajh mein nahi baayega.."
Bas free k chakkar me jita hai 
"This guy always misleading the ppl (2nd Dhruv rathee ) , Kerala story is not propaganda whether it‚Äôs 32k or 3k or 3 it‚Äôs based on true events . Check the facts and the woman out there openly speaking the truth and showing us all the reality .

You are also a Congress agent... Don't worry people can understand
Jai sidhu
Bjp will be back strongly....ur own congress people flock to bjp...
"Hypocrisy is that you are happy about Congress' win and wish that it wins further, because you are not happy with what BJP is doing; as if Congress is any better."
Tu Deshbakth nahi hai. Paisa ka bhakt hai.
Telangana and Andhra will never bring BJP to power. Forget it. We are religious but not andh bhakts.
freebies
"Hello Mr. Congress Gulam, I am from Karnataka. The reason Congress won in K'taka was dismal performance of state BJP on one hand and 5 false promises of freebies by Congress. That's it. End of story. Modi wave is intact.(36% voteshare of BJP hasn't changed since 2018) Don't even dream that the same thing will happen in LS elections. Mark my words, BJP will win 18-20 (out of 28) seats in the same Karnataka, and craps like you will then be left with nothing but EVM to shift the blame on."
GAYHIND
Mahabharat se kurava (adharma ) adhikar mila ..phir dharm ka war hua dont worry after 5 year phir BJP ayegi ...tera excitement jald katham hogi
No offence but you see they have so many free things like AAP to get these votes. First takeaway is that give free and second is don't do hindu muslim but do caste divide when your own party have two big people having fight and you make them handshake just for the sake of votes is just greediness and nothing else and yes AEGA TOH MODI HI.
This guy and channel seems like doing advertising in favour of a particular party.
"Karnataka didnt vote against Modi. We voted against useless Bommai. Even if lok sabha elections held, BJP will highest seats!"
Yrs
Always BJP 
Pure Congress Chamcha hypocrite
