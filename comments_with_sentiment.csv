"To all the north indians saying karnataka is next kerala, Listen I am karnataka guy but we should focus in development of the nation not religious politics, we need a responsible regime, may it be Modi's Bjp or Rahul's congress. If we hate muslims then we can just ignore them instead of harassing them lets move on. We are already called an islamophobic nation and third world country 2 big titles lol. Muslims will never be majority in india according to dew report but still some north hindus are always harassing and mob lynching muslims which brings shame to whole nation. I was islamophobic too but now i just ignore them and move on. No need of unnecessary fights. Now everyone just focus on development of the country. And Narendra Modi will win again next year and take over india but this time lets ignore religious politics and focus on development of the nation. We know to protect our dharma so dw hindus are in majority in south plus population of hindus are rising in karnataka without checking facts you north indians come and say that karnataka is under muslim which doesnt has any logic. Hindu population is more than 80% in karnataka and all political candidates are hindus so how tf are you saying that? You deserve to he called andhbakts. We know to handle muslims if they try to mess with our religion so dont worry we are descendents of cholas,cheras,kadambas, kittur chennama we have warrior blood in us. We will join north for a akhand bharath where everyone lives peacefully. But again dont teach us anything we are hindus too but with a different culture and different mindset. We want hindu rashtra too but without harming anyone of other faiths. If youre really concerned about their population growth then you can check the current stats. Dont just believe in media. I support Modi for india. But for now let us see what Congress can deliver and if Rahul gandhi and his people didnt fulfil the promises then we will overthrow the government next time so dont worry. Our south india especially karnataka is very much developed and compared to north and we need some more time to further improve it. I dont see muslims as a problem cause i barely see muslims in my city so dont worry. Hindi rashtra will form one day soon and akhand bharat too!! But following our dharma we shouldnt harass anyone. We also will bring population control bill which is very much necessary. And talking about banning hijab, then let us ban burqa(black raincoat) but not hijab, muslim girls need hijab or head scarf during their festivals thats their belief making them sad is not the way, Ban burqa but let them wear a scarf and they can remove it inside school or workplace but in public place is for safety a piece of scarf cant harm anyone and also they can remove it if they feel safe, if hindu women can wear saree in arab nations, turkic nations and even pakistan then why muslims cant wear a piece of cloth on their head? Yes burqa should be banned i agree with that. If all hold hands we can focus more on the development, which ever muslim or anyone does any crime let us give that person very serious punishment but no need to bring religious fights. Also stop comparing india with shithole pakistan or poor bangladesh, let us compare with china and grow by giving competition to it, and  Hindu rashtra will form sooner than we think but we dont need a underdeveloped nation at that time cos everyone outside the nation will make fun of us!!","{'neg': 0.15, 'neu': 0.706, 'pos': 0.143, 'compound': -0.7149}"

Everyone will realise how bjp plays communal game and slowly they'll get vanished. I voted for bjp too but slowly realised they gain vote by dividing people not by working. Karnataka did the right thing and whole india will slowly come to know what game they are playing. I have hindu and muslim friends and nobody never fights but bjp created a fear and wants to seperate hindu because of majority. Nobody ever wanted a country divided but they are fighting for hindus instead of developing the country. Except hindus all the other religions are are in fear. Bjp' s policies are RSS based.

Now say me, when is welfare not welfare. Shouldnt welfare schemes should be carefully designed keeping in mind the current state of transport and electric board financial condition? These welfare schemes dont seem to impact good in long term for beneficiaries or bring them out of poverty. And these schemes demand nearly 65000 crores of additional money for government. Just examine the worsening financial state of KSRTC and BMTC, they are already in heavy losses. And nothing is being done to help the systems caught in losses and debt. Even little improper management of money and late payment to the transport department for this free facility will create more debt for transport facility and long term loss for it. And same with electricity boards. And to remember, 65000 crores dedicated to these schemes will pool in less money for governance, maintainance,  health facility, government school facility, infrastructure. Isn't this a heavy toll? Karnataka isn't a tax surplus state to go this full on freebies for 5yrs. It's already in heavy debt. Major chunk of state's yearly budget is debt. I thought you will mention all of these.
